The configuration for defining transparency, darkening windows, floating, and hiding elements has been moved to the *options* table.

The updated configuration keys are as follows:
- |transparent| -> |options.transparent|
- |hide_end_of_buffer| -> |options.hide_end_of_buffer|
- |hide_inactive_statusline| -> |options.hide_nc_statusline|
- |dark_float| -> |options.darken.floats|
- |dark_sidebar|-> |options.darken.sidebars.enable|
- |sidebars|-> |options.darken.sidebars.list|

Date: April 12, 2023

The configuration for defining styles has been migrated to *options.styles*. As
part of this migration, *msg_area_style* has been removed.

Here is the updated config keys:
- |comment_style| -> |options.styles.comments|
- |function_style| -> |options.styles.functions|
- |keyword_style| -> |options.styles.keywords|
- |variable_style| -> |options.styles.variables|
- |msg_area_style| -> Removed.

Date: April 11, 2023

In the |setup| function, the |theme_style| option has been removed, and the
process of setting the colorscheme has been changed, It is important to note
that the configuration may undergo further changes in the future, and will be
described in the latest changelogs and documentation.

Additionally, the currently used colorscheme palettes within the *palette*
module have been given the prefix |'github_'|.

Old approach for setting the theme:
>
  require('github-theme').setup({
    theme_style = 'dark',
    --- ...
  })
<
New approach for setting the theme:
>
  require('github-theme').setup({
    --- ...
  })

  vim.cmd('colorscheme github_dark')
  -- or
  -- vim.cmd.colorscheme('github_dark')

Date: April 06, 2023

The secondary method of assigning configuration variables using
|'vim.g.github_*'| is now considered deprecated. Instead, it is recommended to
use the |'require("github-theme").setup({...})'| function to assign
configurations.

Any references to the deprecated modules and options can be found in the
documentation located at `:h gt_deprecated.txt`.

I (ful1e5) wanted to let you know that we now have support for new treesitter
highlighting groups, thanks to a contribution from |@luisiacc|. If you are
using an older version of treesitter, please switch to the `v0.7` release tag,
which is the last version for you to take advantage of the old treesitter
highlights. We will continue to develop and support these new highlighting
groups going forward.

In addition, I am planning a major refactor of the codebase to make it
compatible with |Neovim-0.9| and will be starting a discussion on GitHub soon.
To ensure that the community is aware of any major changes before they are
implemented, I will provide advance warning before any potentially breaking
changes are pushed to upstream.

This small change is made for differentiate the inactive Statusline and
tabline from the background.

A list of changes that have been made:

- Minimal look deprecated for |lualine|.
    This deprecation is related to `hide_inactive_statusline` option. This
    means the theme will not force the |underline| style to inactive lualine.
- Native lualine theme support terminal highlights |terminal-config|
- Inactive tabline highlights got enhanced.
